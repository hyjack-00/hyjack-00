## hyjack-00

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm hyjack-00 (Jack Huang), a spirited CS undergrad at Sun Yat-sen University. Currently, I'm proudly donning the jersey as a member of the Sun Yat-sen University Supercomputing Team, and flexing my muscles in the Aero-Swift Team's Vision Division. 

ðŸš€ **My Interests:** ðŸš€

- My compass points toward the intricate world of High-Performance Computing and the exciting realms of Machine-Learning Systems. I find joy in making code sprint on computers, unleashing that untapped turbo boost on today's hardware. However, I'm just dipping my toes into this field.
- I've dabbled in performance optimization on various architectures like x86, aarch64 (ARMv8), nvidia-CUDA, amd-CDNA, and even China's Sunway supercomputer. Mostly, it's been optimizing simple BLAS operators.
- I'm also intrigued by speeding up training and inference of neural network models (especially the LLM), AI compilers, and heterogeneous computing devices.

Waiting for you to have a virtual coffee and brainstorm together on these exciting horizons!

ðŸ“« **How to Reach Me:**

Feel free to drop me a message on [my student email](huangyj285@mail2.sysu.edu.cn). Let's make the virtual world a bit smaller together!
